# 🚀 AI-Driven LinkedIn Content Automation | n8n + LLM Integration

## 🔎 Project Summary

Designed and implemented an end-to-end AI-powered automation workflow using **n8n** that generates and publishes structured LinkedIn posts in seconds.

This solution eliminates manual drafting, formatting, and posting — enabling consistent thought leadership with near-zero operational overhead.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Professionals and operators spend significant time:

* Drafting content (15–20 mins)
* Structuring and formatting posts
* Switching between tools (ChatGPT → Docs → LinkedIn)
* Manually publishing content

For 3 posts per week:

* ~6 hours/month
* ~72 hours/year
* High cognitive load
* Inconsistent execution

Content consistency suffers due to friction.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

Built a fully automated workflow that:

1. Accepts a simple natural language prompt
2. Uses an AI Agent (Google Generative AI integration) to:

   * Structure content professionally
   * Add formatting and engagement hooks
   * Maintain contextual tone using memory
3. Automatically publishes to LinkedIn via API

Total execution time: **~30 seconds per post**

---

## 🏗 Architecture

**Trigger → AI Agent → LinkedIn Publish**

* **Trigger:** Chat message input
* **AI Model:** Google Generative AI
* **Automation Platform:** n8n
* **Integration:** LinkedIn API (Create Post)
* **Optional:** Memory node for contextual improvements
